# SL_2(Z)

In the SL_2(Z) game, you use the D-pad to multiply the displayed
matrix by other matrices.  Your goal is to restore the matrix to the
identity (or its negative) before time is up.  Up and down are
inverses, as are right and left, and a button press acts as an "undo."
If you multiply by too many matrices, you also lose.

The background displays the upper half plane transformed by the
corresponding fractional linear transformation.  Consequently, you can
also think of your goal as restoring a "quilt" pattern.
