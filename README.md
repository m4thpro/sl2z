# SL₂(ℤ)

In the SL₂(ℤ) game, you use the D-pad to multiply the displayed matrix
by other matrices.  Your goal is to restore the matrix to the identity
(or its negative) before time is up.  Up and down are inverses, as are
right and left, and a button press acts as an "undo."  If you multiply
by too many matrices, you also lose.

The background displays the upper half plane transformed by the
corresponding linear fractional transformation.  Consequently, you can
also think of your goal as restoring a "quilt" pattern.

And instead of thinking of it as a game of multiplying matrices, you
can instead regard it as a game of row reduction.  "Left and right"
and "up and down" then add or subtract one row from the other.
